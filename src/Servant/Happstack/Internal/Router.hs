-- | Smart constructor for the choice between routers.
-- We currently optimize the following cases:
--
--   * Two static routers can be joined by joining their maps.
--   * Two dynamic routers can be joined by joining their codomains.
--   * Two 'WithRequest' routers can be joined by passing them
--     the same request and joining their codomains.
--   * A 'WithRequest' router can be joined with anything else by
--     passing the same request to both but ignoring it in the
--     component that does not need it.
